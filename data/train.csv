- Problem 1: The ""dirty"" indicator for this file should show up in the breadcrumb, but it is missing.
- Now hover over the 1st (leftmost) tab.
- Problem 2: This file is not ""dirty"", and yet its breadcrumb is showing a ""dirty"" indicator asterisk.

The bug is that an element with id ""dirty"" is being created for each breadcrumb (on line 152 in breadcrumbs.js).
So when the browser is asked for an element with that id (on line 368 of globalCommands.js) it just returns the first one found.

The breadcrumb ""dirty"" id needs to be made unique per file/tab/breadcrumb, and the mechanism for adding/removing the indicator needs to use the unique id.
(Either that, or implement it in a way that doesn't use an id).

This is also causing an ""ids must be unique on the page"" accessibility scanning violation."

"In Capella, editors are not closed when closing the session after a restart"	"n Sirius, the org.eclipse.sirius.ui.business.internal.session.EditingSession tracks editors attached to a given Session. It allows to close them when closing the session. 
After a restart with already opened editors, the EditingSession does not track editors references until the focus is set on them. When closing the session, the EditingSession search for editor referencing the current session (closeOthersEditors method). This task is launched asynchronously on the UI thread. It works properly in Sirius but in the Capella context, the Session is closed before the execution of the closeOthersEditors: the session resources cannot be retrieve and it cannot find references editor.

Import IFE samble
Open the project
Open several diagrams (at least 2)
restart
Close the session => KO, only one editor (the one with the focus) is closed and the other ones are still opened."
